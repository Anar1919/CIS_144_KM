# Assgiment 1
Open [src](./src) directory to see assignment information

# Explanation
Each assigment would be its separate git repository, sdutents would fork it, open up GitHub Codespace, write the program, and commit the changes. 
After the changes have been commited, the student would open a pull request in the original repository.

# Instructions

This section would contain instruction on how to clone a repository, enter Codespace, run and test the program, and submit the result.
There can also be an instruction to synchronize the cloned repository with the original one, in case some changes would be made to it.
