# Part 1

Write and application that reads five integers and determines and prints the highest and the lowest integers number. You need to create a method to get the highest, and 1 to get the lowest… Make sure than your method is not more than 3 lines of code.

# Part 2

Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost (you need to implement a Method with 5 input parameters and return a double), so you can estimate how much money could be saved by car-pooling (you don’t need to calculate car-pooling cost… just driving cost). The application should input information and display the user’s cost per day of driving to work:

1. Total miles driven per day
2. Cost per gallon of gasoline.
3. Average miles per gallon.
4. Parking fees per day.
5. Tolls per day.
